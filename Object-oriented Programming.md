# Python OOPS Concepts

## Functions 

#### What is a function? What are the parameters and arguments?
- A function is a block of code that you can name and that performs a certain task
- You can run the block many times by using the function that specifies its name and the data the function needs to work
- Parameters are the variables in the function that hold this data
- An argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is called


#### What is a function call?
- To use a function, you call it
- When you call a function, you must provide values, or arguments, for each of the parameters of the function

#### What are functions used for?
- Functions allow you to write code efficiently
- When you need to act more than once, wrap that code in a function and call it when you need it
- When you need to change how the action is carried out, you can change the code in the function, and the improvement is applied everywhere
